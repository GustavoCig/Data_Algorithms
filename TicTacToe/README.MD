# Introduction

This algorithm creates a tic-tac-toe game between the user and the CPU.
The intelligence used in the CPU is based in the results from a model trained using a dataset of 1000 randomly generated games, using the SVM algorithm supplied by WEKA.
The CPU's main goal is winning, therefore, it won't, necessarily, stop the players advances, instead it will focus on which moves can bring it closer to victory.

# Team

This algorithm was developed alongside my friend and colleague, [Yuri Witney](https://github.com/YuriWitney), as an assignment from our Data Mining University Course. Yuri was the main force behind it's development while I developed secondary methods and functions.

This code was submitted to my git simply as a means of safe keeping.
